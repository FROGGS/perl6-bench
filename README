perl6-bench: A tool to benchmark and compare Perl 6 implementations against perl5

This is a VERY EARLY RELEASE, and represents concept-as-code.  No attempt has
been made to bulletproof the tool.  Run as:

    perl path/to/bench

You will need at least perl5 5.10.x, and you may need to have some extra
items in your PATH, such as a recent version of mono-sgen for Niecza and node
for perlito5.js.  YMMV.

Paths to the proper working directory for each compiler (usually the root
directory of its Git checkout) can be set in the %COMPILERS hash at the top
of the bench script.  The default directories are assumed to be parallel
checkouts at the same directory level as the perl6-bench checkout.  For
example, Perlito's directory is assumed to be ../Perlito/ relative to the
bench directory.

Compilers tested so far:

    Perl 5
        perl5
        perlito5.pl
        perlito5.js
    Perl 6
        perl6 (Rakudo)
        niecza
    NQP
        nqp (github perl6/nqp)

Enjoy!
