perl6-bench: A tool to benchmark and compare Perl 6 implementations against perl5

This is a FIRST RELEASE, and represents concept-as-code.  No attempt has been
made to bulletproof the tool.  Run as:

    perl path/to/bench

You will need at least perl5 5.10.x.

I ran this successfully with Rakudo installed as 'perl6' and in my path, a recent
build of 'mono-sgen' in my path, and cd'ed in the top level of a recently built
Niecza checkout.  YMMV.

Enjoy!
