perl6-bench: A tool to benchmark and compare implementations of Perl family languages

This is an EARLY RELEASE, and no attempt has been made to bulletproof the tools.
A sample sequence for building, benchmarking, and comparing a few compilers is
as follows:

    ./bench setup
    ./bench extract nqp niecza rakudo
    ./bench build nqp/2012.11 rakudo/2012.11 niecza/v22
    ./bench time nqp/2012.11 rakudo/2012.11 niecza/v22
    ./bench analyze --compare results/*/*.json

You will need at least perl5 5.10.x, and you may need to have some extra
items in your PATH, such as a recent version of mono-sgen for Niecza and
node/d8 for Perlito*/JS.  YMMV.

Paths to the proper working directory of compilers not yet handled by the
"./bench extract" mechanism can be set in the %COMPILERS hash at the top
of the timeall script.  The default directories are assumed to be created
by extract, or in parallel checkouts at the same directory level as the
perl6-bench checkout.  For example, Perlito's directory is currently assumed
to be ../Perlito/ relative to the bench directory; eventually it will be
clonable and extractable in the same way as nqp, niecza, and rakudo.

Compilers tested so far:

    Perl 5
        perl5
        perlito5.pl
        perlito5.js/node
        perlito5.js/d8
    Perl 6
        rakudo
        niecza
        perlito6.pl
        perlito6.js/d8
    NQP
        nqp    (github perl6/nqp)
        rakudo
        niecza (no pir:: or nqp:: support)

Enjoy!
