* Add Pugs to known compilers
* Support skipping individual tests for particular compilers
  + Display skips as SKIP instead of FAIL in summary table
* Test relative speed of $i++ and $i := $i + 1 in NQP
  + If little slowdown, switch NQP tests to latter to support Rakudo
* Correct rc-forest-fire variants to produce more similar output
* More tests!
  + Specific ideas
    - Construct a triangular sequence in an array, then print it
    - Round trip a CSV file, correctly handling escapes and non-ASCII chars
    - Round trip XML through a friendly internal structure (XML::Simple-ish)
    - Extract info from a PNG file
    - Compute positions for a particle system after N steps
  + Areas to cover
    - Something for big int
