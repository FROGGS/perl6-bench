* Top tasks
  + Bring forward existing JS-targeting compilers to new component framework
  + Add pmurias' nqp-js and rakudo-js compilers
  + Bring back the ability to test Perl 6 compilers against NQP code (jnthn++)
* Features
  + Documentation
    - WIP: manpage/usage
    - WIP: data expected from each test, and analysis of results
  + Add platform info to timeall output:
    - OS version
    - uname -a
    - /proc/cpuinfo
    - /proc/meminfo
  + Auto-tune iteration count or other run-time parameters to make each test
    run for a given minimum time (e.g. 10 seconds minimum) to get a stable
    seconds/iteration value as benchmark output
    - Specify per-test whether to do per-iteration or per-run timing
  + Options to list known languages, implementations, tests, etc.
  + Add Pugs to known compilers
  + Compare against results of a previous run
  + Output version of each compiler (plus platform summary) from analyze
  + Group tests and total by group in summaries
    - trivial, simulation, parsing, ...
  + Tag tests:
    - Query/total by tag
    - Run only tests in tag
* More tests!
  + diakopter++'s ideas:
    - Add a push-then-join test to go with the push and concat tests
    - Closure creation/invocation
    - Argument passing, for different numbers of arguments
    - Lexical/dynamic lookup, with varying depth
    - Raw object (bare class) creation, both new anon class, and new on existing class
    - Object creation in class with attributes
    - Single Unicode property lookup in a regex a bunch of times
    - Multiple Unicode property lookup in a regex a bunch of times
    - Multimethod dispatch
    - Multisub dispatch
    - Man-or-boy 1..20
  + Known performance changes
    - Rakudo

  + Specific ideas
    - Construct a triangular sequence in an array, then print it
    - Round trip a CSV file, correctly handling escapes and non-ASCII chars
    - Round trip XML through a friendly internal structure (XML::Simple-ish)
    - Extract info from a PNG file
    - Compute positions for a particle system after N steps
    - Parse dotty file and generate graph data structure from it
  + Areas to cover
    - Something for big int
